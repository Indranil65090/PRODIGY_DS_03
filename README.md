# PRODIGY_DS_03

This project implements scikit-learn library for predictability analysis.
The code follows a structured workflow that encompasses data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, accuracy evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree.

DATA LOADING AND PRE-PROCESSING

The code loads a dataset, likely using scikit-learn's tools, and preprocesses the data to ensure it is suitable for training the decision tree classifier.

DATA TREE MODEL TRAINING

Utilizing scikit-learn's decision tree classifier, the code trains a model on the preprocessed dataset. This involves learning the decision boundaries and patterns within the data.

PREDICTION AND ACCURACY EVALUATION

The trained decision tree is used to make predictions on new or test data. This step allows assessing the model's ability to generalize to unseen instances.
The code assesses the performance of the decision tree classifier by calculating accuracy metrics. This involves comparing the model's predictions to the actual outcomes in the test dataset.

DECISION TREE VISUALIZATION

The code generates a visual representation of the decision tree using tools provided by scikit-learn or other visualization libraries. This visualization aids in understanding the structure and decision-making process of the trained model.

In summary, we used the dataset to predict and evaluate accuracy and eventually visulized the dataset
